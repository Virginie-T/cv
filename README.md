## Formation

**Founders and Coders**              
*Javascript web development*         
> Founders & Coders runs the UK's leading training in software development.
> It's a JavaScript-driven curriculum that immerses you in the latest web technologies including Node.js, React and hapi.

**Epicodus**               
*Software Bootcamp, Web Development, PHP, Javascript and Drupal*

> I learned new programming languages as : PHP, PostgreSQL, Twig, Silex, JavaScript, jQuery, Mocha, Chai, MVC, AngularJS and Drupal; and developing my pair programming skills. Every day, I'm building small applications, debugging and solving code issues. I'm getting better and I like that because - yet a team player - I'm pretty competitive.

**Institut supérieur libre des Arts plastiques - Ecole de Recherche graphique**             
*Web Design / Web development / Visuel and graphic communication*

> I got a new approach of the design based on experimentations and research. I did one year in Visual and Graphic Communication and I loved it.

**Portland Code School**               
*Primer Capstone Project*

> Introduction to front-end development.
I worked in group projects: brainstorming, the division of tasks, team interaction... from idea forming to project development to completion. Example of a project: creation of a website for a massage business (homepage, description, offers + prices, location, contact info, etc.)

**Portland Code School**               
*Front End Development*

> More in-depth exposure to front end development (HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Sass).
Small group projects : responsible design site development.
Activités et associations : Worked with Al Zimmerman in developing a mobile game application ("QuizZz") for Julie Cruyt. Worked with Garin on a freelance project in Wordpress to develop a website for "Culture Feed" : an international cultural travelling platform for youngsters to enable them to share what's "in" in their respective countries.
